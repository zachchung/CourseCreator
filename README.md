# CourseCreator - The Digital Classroom for Everyone
CourseCreator is a web app that helps educators quickly transfer existing knowledge to digital format and share it with students. At this stage, the resources are lesson module and quiz module.

- Quiz module has a quiz builder for quiz, questions and answers.
- Lesson module contains text, multimedia (e.g., image and videos) and reference link to external resources.

To create content on the website, we use a Trix text editor that is natively integrated into ActionText module of Ruby on Rails version 6.
